CRUD operations map to HTTP in expected way
	create - put
	read - get
	update - post
	delete - delete
	
Because the models are bundled discretely 

GET /classes/1/students
should return the same thing as
GET /students/?class=1

and GET /classes/1/rules
should return the same thing as 
GET /rules/?class=1

the following are the top level url nouns

/students
/classes
/seatingrules
/seatingcharts

Creating a single entity and multiple entities should be done with the same syntax, but
different json

e.g., to create a single student

PUT /students

{
	lastName:Harting
	firstName:David
	classes:[1,2,3]
}

but to create multiple students

PUT /students

{
	students:[{...}, {...}, {...}]
}
