I can't decide if it's better to have each class contain a list of students,
or for each student to have a list of classes they are in. 
I think the more common query would be - "show me all the students in class x", so 
I'm leaning toward classes containing students. 
	
	
need some sort of authentication on class. Need to make sure teachers can only see their own classes.
